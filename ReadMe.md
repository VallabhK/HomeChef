> `conda config --add channels conda-forge`
- Once the conda-forge channel has been enabled, pypdf2 can be installed with:
> `conda install pypdf2`

- Select the compatible driver for your Chrome version
- To check the Chrome version you are using, click on the three vertical dots on the top right corner
- Then go to Help -> About Google Chrome
